In this model, I have taken a dataset having various parameters such as number of Pregnancies, Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin Level, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age and the final outcome.
Here, the main goal is to determine or predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on the above parameters.
In this model, the major algorithm used is K-Nearest Neighbour.
The repository containes codes for datapreprocessing, feature scaling, training, testing, visualisation, etc.
